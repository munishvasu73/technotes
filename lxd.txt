 Increasing file and inode limits
Since it’s entirely possible we may in the future wish to run multiple LXD containers, it’s a good idea to already increase the number of open files and inode limits, this will prevent the dreaded “too many open files” errors which commonly occur with container solutions.

For the inode limits, open the sysctl.conf file as follows:

sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf

Now add the following lines, as recommended by the LXD project

fs.inotify.max_queued_events = 1048576
fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 1048576
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 1048576
