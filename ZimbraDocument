Get all user's mailbox size from CLI

Run following command as zimbra user to check all user's mailbox size:-

su - zimbra
all_accounts=`zmprov -l gaa`; for account in $all_accounts; do mbox_size=`zmmailbox -z -m $account gms`; echo "Mailbox size of $account = $mbox_size"; done ;

Check forwarder

run as zimbra script

The first step is create the script like root user:
vi checkforward.sh
Add the next simple script into the Script file:
#!/bin/sh
# Script para visualizar redirecciones en Zimbra
for account in `zmprov -l gaa`; do
forwardingaddress=`zmprov ga $account |grep 'zimbraPrefMailForwardingAddress' |sed 's/zimbraPrefMailForwardingAddress: //'`
if [ "$forwardingaddress" != "" ]; then
echo "$account is forwarding to $forwardingaddress"
else
forwardingaddress=""
fi
done
Save the file, and add it the proper rights for the user Zimbra, and make it executable:
chown zimbra:zimbra checkforward.sh
chmod +x checkforward.sh
Like zimbra user, you can run the script, and you will see something like the next:
./checkforward.sh
admin@zimbra.local is forwarding to externalaccount@externaldomain.com
testmove@example1.com is forwarding to externalaccount2@externaldomain2.com
